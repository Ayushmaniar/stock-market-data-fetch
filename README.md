Usage

```
pip install pandas yfinance PyQt5 tqdm openpyxl xlsxwriter
pip install PyInstaller
```

Once you have installed all these libraries, you would need to actually build the app with this command.
Note : This command might take 3-4 minutes to run

```
python -m PyInstaller final_app_build_script.py
```
After this you would be able to locate the app inside the dist/final_app_build_script folder
